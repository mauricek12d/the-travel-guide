              We have been going to Cape May, NJ for over 30 years or more. We
              love the Victorian Motel which is just at the end of the
              Victorian Mall (across from Congress Hall). It is close to the
              beautiful homes which we take walks to see.

              High Point has Gorgeous scenery with a Lovely little spot to
              picnic when itâ€™s a quiet day. We picnicked by the beach. Water was
              clear and cool!
